                    from when I used to have a job

            <p8>Here we can see me in my natural habitat, which
            is on the water.  For the last 10 years I worked in 
            the boating industry, starting as a SCUBA instructor, 
            then as general crew on other types of boats, then 
            advancing to captain.  Most of that time was spent on 
            the island of Maui, but I worked 2 summers out of Seward, 
            Alaska as well.<br>Recently I made to move to upstate 
            New York due to family concerns.  As there is no 
            boating in the area, I was forced to make a career 
            change, and as there are no interesting jobs in the 
            area, I decided to pick up a skill I could use from 
            anywhere.  After some debating, coding seemed like 
            the solution, and after some searching, Coding Temple 
            seemed like the way to go.

                <figcaption style="float:right;">Since everyone 
                    is so into food around here, I thought maybe I 
                    would show my idea of comfort food...

            <p10>Here we can see some delicious noodles, which are an 
            important part of a healthy diet.  This may not sound 
            like advice you'd get from a doctor, and it's not.  
            You just have to trust me, I wouldn't make this up.
